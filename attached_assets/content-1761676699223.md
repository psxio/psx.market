### Non-Derivative Design

Unlike perpetual futures or options, OMM is not a derivative, simplifying trading by eliminating the need for additional liquidity requirements and providing a direct way to long or short assets onchain.

### Oracle Independence

It relies on a native Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle rather than external oracles, ensuring a secure, permissionless trading environment free from the vulnerabilities of third-party price feeds.

### Fully Decentralized Architecture

Every element of OMM is decentralized, offering a trustless platform that aligns with the ethos of DeFi and eliminates centralized points of failure.

### Open Liquidity Provision

There are no permissioned market makers—anyone can participate as a liquidity provider, benefiting from double capital efficiency and removing barriers to liquidity bootstrapping.
