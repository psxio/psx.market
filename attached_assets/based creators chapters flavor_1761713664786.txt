I love these ideas man and the based creators regional local chapters we partner with thru pizzadao will be able to have the students and leaders of those chapters make these and more for us, AND we can work together on distribution thru the app store and base app

Ryan Kagy, [10/24/2025 10:31 PM]
yeah who do we have in pizzadao network who could help us get a room at their local university or city community center

snax y-not, [10/24/2025 10:34 PM]
probably plenty

Ryan Kagy, [10/24/2025 10:34 PM]
as a dedicated space for creators in that city or uni:

- weekly meetings for visitors and members of the based creators/pizzadao
- daily classes
- monthly events on campus grounds or city parks or other locales we can organize thru the leadership network which will help us govern in a more decentralized way, from the global chapter (what we have now) to the regional chapters (a crew with a crew leader each country) to the local chapters (country crew leaders help spark local leaders)

snax y-not, [10/24/2025 10:34 PM]

I had a great 1 to 1 with @Queue1337 yesterday evening. we were discussing how clanker was acquired, and how NodeMerch had just listed the 1 year clanker anniversary merch drop which immediately blew up https://nodemerch.com/store/clanker (make sure to get one ASAP by the way, designed by @FFFFLOOD who we need to get in here, I sent him an invite already)

he walked me thru how simple and easy it was to go from signing in at https://nodemerch.com/ to creating this store for our client Nemesis in just a minute or two, including mockup design and everything. this is going to be huge for all the creators we onboard to use and deploy their merch with worldwide fulfillment by luminode, and we should all think about how we can integrate these dead simple onchain merch stores as a lego building block for all the products we are building as a group. if you haven't met @Queue1337 yet, definitely setup a 1 to 1 with him and check out the product:

https://nodemerch.com/store/NemesisTestStore/product/68faaa74a1d01c58f03fe539

we ended up on this note: we need a fast way to pass business between us as a group, since we're all super busy. we're thinking of starting a weekly meetup.

we'll try to make it 30 minutes max per week, so we can just get the most important updates from each other, setup up 1 to 1s, and get on with our days.

each member of our group will get 1-3 minutes to stand up and give a weekly ask for the rest of the group:

- what events, products or tokens are you or your partners or clients launching this week that you need support on?
- what are you, your partners, or your clients working on this week or this month that may benefit from collaboration?
- what specific types of customers or audience members or business contacts are you looking for this week?
- what resources, offers, and information do you have to share this week?

action items from each meeting:

- take note of others asks for synergies
- set up 1 to 1 meetings to follow up
- pass referrals, get referrals, close business
- collab on events and product and token rollouts

what do you guys think? this is inspired by https://bni.com which is a chapter based B2B networking org. we are already using this as a weekly structure for the Based Creators Regional and Local Chapters. thinking this will be our Global Chapter since this group is almost everyone we are immediately working with.

@jkcharters we do need to bring in gold tokens into many many of these discussions at this point, since the global demand for gold as a money is about to compete with stablecoins in a big way, so we should all be considering how to integrate gold RWA tokens into our products. I briefly met him at Onchain Summit but we didnt get to connect beyond that, can you invite him in here? think he will be an essential member of the global chapter so we can trickle down the integrations to regional and local levels

Hey, I've already introduced myself, so to all the new creators here or those who I haven't met yet!
I'm Ryan Kagy

base.app/profile/rskagy

I'm building the Create on Base ICM with over 30 other founders, and we're building interoperable protocol layers on Base for creator industry verticals (books, music, movies/tv, gaming, events, merch), alongside the Based Creators Global Chapters, a regional-to-local decentralized network of Based Creator leadership chapters in countries and cities around the world. We're already speaking with our first universities and cities as we prepare to kickstart the cultural movement to Create on Base. We have a long term vision of onboarding the next generation of artists, musicians, designers, and creators of all kinds to in-person workshops, weekly Based Creator Local Chapter B2B creator/entrepreneur growth & support venues, and Based Creators events in cities and universities around the world.

create.blue (simply create.🟦, with "create" translated to any language) will become a global marketing campaign and base-coded cultural movement to Create on the Blue App, and invite people to start creating in a different way, and challenge the authority of the current creative industry that aim to extract max value from creators. Create on Base will become a calling to create in a more Based way, to create a more Based future for yourself and your family and friends as a  Creator, and to Create a Based World that we want to see for the generation that follows.

How you can help: 

As a fellow builder building products for creators & creator distribution channels to consumers: our goal is to provide pluggable high quality content to all base ecosystem builder apps across creator verticals, so it becomes easier for builders to deliver the best content across the network. if you're interested in being an interface partner (i.e. plugging in the Based Creators Network Content into your frontend, app, game or build however you see fit) - let's chat about integrating your product for creators into the network, and start teaching your product in classes around the world, OR let's chat about plugging the Based Creators Network Content into your distribution channel.

As a leader: We're looking for volunteers to found a Based Creators Regional Chapter in your country's region, and to begin the process of helping us roll out to the Local level as we then target the universities and major cities in that region with our decentralized rollout structure.

As a Based Creator: We're currently planning the full launch of create.blue to coincide with this global campaign to Create on Base. As a creator, your art, music, game, movie, book or event could be potentially given a global audience thru our marketing campaign, as well as potential attention from financial backers to grow with us.

As ANYONE: 

We're looking to establish connections with more universities and cities to grow our network of physical, in-person venues to fuel the creator education and onboarding goals of Regional and Local chapters around the globe onboarding creators from cities and universities directly to base

We're always looking to expand the Chapter Network until there is a Based Creators Chapter in every local area. We're partnered with and members of PizzaDAO, and are bootstrapping the Global Pizza Network to bring more creators to PizzaDAO while also helping to connect the local Based Creators chapters to Pizza Day parties and the global culture of Ethereum which is so important for education and networking of new creators starting their onchain journey for the first time.

We are looking to network and learn more about everyone! We're running a fully decentralized creative venture and development agency in the background of all this, and this is one of its many current ventures.

gm gm frens. we're rolling out in a big way right now. updates above. we're bringing in more leaders for regional chapters now for anyone interested in volunteering, and there's some pretty big moves happening behind the scenes so lets follow up on a 1 to 1 for anyone who wants to catch up
