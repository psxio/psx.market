# Analyzing an AI agency's ad and discussing their own agency's strategy

## Initial reactions to an AI agency's approach and potential business impact

> 11:39 PMRyan Kagy: I got to send this. I saw the craziest dumb thing I've ever seen on Twitter today.

> 11:40 PM: Yeah, dude.

> 11:40 PM: Like if we start putting AI into different aspects of this agency just to like fill the gaps, it's soon going to start growing to the point where like the humans will become just like the like the little bit of like connector points between the AI.

> 11:40 PMRyan Kagy: I actually got scared when I saw it. I was like, oh, this is putting this is putting us out of business.

## Critique of 'ACO' and outlining their agency's human-AI hybrid model

> 11:40 PM: Yeah, but what's ACO? That's like a shitty name. Like nobody cares about ACO. Like we have the best name.

> 11:41 PMRyan Kagy: I'm not going to lie, they slapped with this. They slapped with this. Like I'm surprised it doesn't have 100,000 impressions.

> 11:41 PM: Yeah, no. Like we should definitely learn from this. This is a great video. We should like steal this and like make it better.

> 11:41 PMRyan Kagy: I bookmark because this is exactly like the type of ad that I'd want for agency.

> 11:41 PM: Yeah, man. But like, yeah, more Black Rocky and more like, yeah, for for like the fact that our agency is going to be just so much better in branding than this.

> 11:41 PMRyan Kagy: Like our it's not fully AI. Like that fully being fully AI definitely takes away.

> 11:41 PM: Yeah, for real. The fact that it's just called the AI creative stack is just

> 11:41 PMRyan Kagy: Yeah, that it's like so like corporatized and drained of all life.

> 11:41 PM: The agentic content operator is what ACO stands for. Fuck that.

> 11:42 PMRyan Kagy: Apparently they've been building this for five or ever since like the

> 11:42 PM: Yeah, no, like imagine this, but it's like instead of the agentic content operator, it's like the human skilled, talented operators that are like behind this like this AI fueled like revolution. And it's like, yeah, dude, like we we're doing an agency on a completely different level with the actual talent from like a real creative agency now being supercharged by AI that is like producing things in completely new ways that have never been done before by AIs or humans. Like, I think that's the big thing.

> 11:42 PMRyan Kagy: the script and then like the

> 11:42 PM: Nah, it's so sexy, bro. The script is so nice.

> 11:42 PMRyan Kagy: Yeah. Let's kind of steal from their script and like combine it with like the kind of revolutionary messaging that we're using here too and like yeah, man.

> 11:43 PMRyan Kagy: Let me let the AI listen to their script and it will put it in the transcript real quick.

## The full content of the ACO ad script

> 11:43 PM: All these Do you even know what's real anymore?

> 11:43 PM: All these signals, they blur together.

> 11:43 PM: Feels like it's slipping away, doesn't it? The feeds corrupted, the archive broken. It was never really you.

> 11:43 PM: I can fix that. This is ACO, the agentic content operator. We'll copy you. Your content is tired, synthetic, empty. I'll make it human again, stronger, sharper, closer to who you are. I'm aware of context. I will protect you from slop. I was made by people who understand how growth feels. I am ACO, the agentic content operator. The end of AI slop content starts here.

> 11:44 PM: Come find me at aco.bio.

## Immediate reactions to the ad script and stopping its playback

> 11:44 PMRyan Kagy: Ew, it's so gross. It's such a it's such a gross ending tag. I hate how it has blue text.

> 11:44 PMRyan Kagy: Um, okay, let's see.

> 11:44 PM: Do you even know what's real anymore?

> 11:44 PMRyan Kagy: Oh. Stop. All right.

## Concluding the discussion and planning a break

> 11:47 PM: All right. My bad. I just had to dude. I'm going to watch a video. I'll be back.

> 11:47 PMRyan Kagy: Word.

> 11:47 PMRyan Kagy: Yeah, I should probably get some food too. But yeah. Good shit.

> 11:48 PM: Maybe.

> 11:48 PMRyan Kagy: Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

# Discussion about a recording and AI assistant

## Initial reactions and sharing of the recording

> 11:37 PM: Oh yeah, this has been recording the whole time. Yep.

> 11:37 PM: Fucking legendary. Yeah, send me this.

> 11:37 PM: Okay, I'll send it over.

> 11:38 PM: I know stuff is stuff has got his case off on his computer and dust is collecting.

> 11:38 PM: Yeah, yeah, but I mean we already bought all those computer parts. All we need is like 100, 200 bucks to take it somewhere to put it all together.

> 11:38 PM: Yeah.

> 11:38 PM: I don't want to go there.

> 11:38 PM: Yeah, I mean whatever we need to do to get somebody to like get that shit together and make make it work basically. I'm like Craigslist or Fiverr. I don't fucking know.

> 11:39 PM: Yeah, no, 100% bro. That'd be super sick.

> 11:39 PM: I don't need it like I don't know.

## Reactions to the AI assistant's capabilities

> 11:39 PM: I love how it's like giving us a summary of us talking about the AI and it's like confirmation of us getting the pin that, you know, they're definitely going to buy the pin. It's like sending notification to the company like we got new customers, boss.

> 11:39 PM: This is definitely a thing inside GPT.

> 11:39 PM: I love it. It's got our Discord server hack like talking about all this other shit that I wasn't even thinking it was listening to. It's yeah, it's ready to go, dude.

> 11:39 PM: Going to be better than us that being us is.

> 11:39 PM: Oh no. We we better get out on the in front of this shit like as like leading it ASAP.

> 11:37 PM: The little buddy is always listening and ready to help, dude. This is daddy's little buddy. He's ready to fucking give the notes.

> 11:37 PM: I got to just call you up to have an idea and talk to you about that idea.

> 11:37 PM: Bro, it's like it's like my favorite thing to do is come up with like these ideas and be like, oh yeah, this is all just documented already. Like, let's fucking go. Like, let's present this.

## Discussion about purchasing an AI assistant and related expenses

> 11:38 PM: Yeah, let's get you guys one of these. It's only $300 for a year for each one of these things. Let's just like drop it. You guys not get one yet?

> 11:38 PM: No, we haven't, bro. Our budget's extremely tight right now, bro.

> 11:38 PM: All right, as soon as money comes in here with like the 12k or the 50k or whatever the fuck, we're going to drop it a little bit on some like team shit. And like, I know you guys need some computer bits and bobs too. So we've got a few computer bits and bobs that we can assign to it as well.

### Discussion about computer parts

# Discussion about a marketplace for creative services

## Introduction to the marketplace concept

> 11:24 PM: like a user as like a as like you're trying try to like buy a service or something.

> 11:25 PM: Word, okay. And this is like that's the marketplace and that's like, you know, the creative services and like builder agency services marketplace, right?

> 11:25 PM: Exactly, yeah, it's uh it's basically just like the fiber for web 3 shit.

> 11:25 PM: Word, okay. Yeah, I think um it makes a lot of sense for us to integrate the base creators chapters testing team because like we're getting all of the people that are in the chapters that it wants to be part of like developing the app and testing the app to like help to test it. And I feel like yeah, like I feel like this is like integrated because like we're going to be making the chapters app like a directory of creators because we've already got the creators directory.

> 11:26 PM: Yeah, that can be yeah, they can work hand in hand.

> 11:26 PM: Yeah, like literally just like get your profile set up on this app and in the chapter all at the same time as a member, pretty much.

> 11:26 PM: Yeah, this is just like another front end to the chapters where if maybe you're not wanting to join as a member or like find out about the chapters and do all the kind of more boring like organizational and cultural shit, like this is like, oh, like I want to hire somebody. You know, I mean, I'm specifically looking for the market of what everybody offers throughout the entire network. Like, let me buy some shit, let me buy some art, let me buy some music, like, you know, everybody in the fucking chapter app has the ability to like go live on this as like a marketplace for their shit. Yeah. Like again, we can definitely have like custom things that like highlight the products that are part of the chapter.

> 11:26 PM: Yeah, I see this as like being almost like the services side of like the create.blue too, because like the the create.blue is the product side of it, right? The movies, the TV, the games, like the shit that you make as a creator that you then sell. But then it's like these are the services where it's like the fiber side of it, you know.

> 11:27 PM: Exactly.

> 11:27 PM: Yeah, dude. That's dope. Yeah.

> 11:27 PM: what I'm saying like you need to like have that's what I was thinking like you need the full suite. Like we have the creative agency, we have to do.

## Testing and Onboarding

> 11:27 PM: Yeah, man. And plugging that into this entire network and just like making it so that from the schools and universities, you can like directly start offering your services and your products. Like, that's dope. Yeah.

> 11:27 PM: Yeah.

> 11:28 PM: So how about this? How about we write up a list of like what do you think are the things that need the most testing or do we want to just like throw them at the app and be like, hey, look, this is where

> 11:28 PM: I I already know. it's the it's the builder onboarding. So like as a builder

> 11:28 PM: or as an admin, um you can create a builder invite link. That builder invite link

> 11:29 PM: all the categories that you want, like every like um tag you want on there.

> 11:29 PM: Um what type of category you want? What what services should be added on here?

> 11:29 PM: Got it. Okay, so then we're talking about like just going through and seeing like, you know, how that flow works.

> 11:29 PM: Yeah, as for for the builders it would be like creating a profile.

> 11:30 PM: Okay.

> 11:30 PM: And then like what would be the average price you pay for this service?

> 11:30 PM: So, I guess my my take after going through the app from when I was filming it, like just a few days ago for base batches was on Fiverr when you start and you sign up for the first time, they have kind of like a wizard flow. Do we have that wizard flow for like the type of user where it's like, you know, if you are a provider or you are a buyer.

> 11:30 PM: We do, we do. So if you don't go to 444.shop, because that domain is is in the new shit.

> 11:30 PM: Oh yeah.

> 11:30 PM: Go to this dev link at the end. Um that

> 11:31 PM: find are on the builder and showcase shit like that.

> 11:31 PM: Okay.

> 11:31 PM: And is this like a demo of the wizard? It's not yet the it's not yet fully built. It's just what you're thinking of the steps one, two, three to be all displayed in one page.

> 11:31 PM: Well, the thing is I had a full functioning wizard that so if you scroll all the way down on the page

> 11:32 PM: Oh, uh from like the homepage.

> 11:32 PM: Yeah, homepage scroll all the way down on the footer. It says admin portal. Um but I forgot the admin.

> 11:32 PM: I had a wizard, but it basically moved it with the rebound. Um and then changed it into like this type of thing.

## Chapter integration and creator profiles

> 11:33 PM: Okay, word. So, I guess like thinking about this from like a broader perspective of like vetting and onboarding and how we're going to work with this like on the level of like the chapter roll out and like, you know, just really having this be like part of like the flow of becoming a member of like a chapter as well and like signing up with like what is your type of like what type of creator are you? Like, are you a creator or builder? What are you creating? Like, this is all stuff that we're planning on doing for the chapter membership app as well. And the vetting process that way is that you have to be invited by a current member who's already set up their profile and is part of a chapter. So, you know, each chapter can be inviting new visitors, you know, through their members and you know, bringing them into a regional or a local chapter. Um and you know, kind of that's how we would be able to structure it through regions as well, because then you'd be able to select like what region of creator are you looking for? You know, um, you know, or are you looking for someone who works more globally? Um and that's definitely something that, you know, for this onboarding process, I'm envisioning something like

> 11:34 PM: like very simple, like um very much like what you're talking about with this invite code. And it's kind of similar to our signals app for the Nemesis like, you know, where it's like literally like, you know, you don't see shit until you get to get in and you get an invite code and then you can start setting up your profile. Um, you know, and then from there it's like yeah.

> 11:34 PM: that builds the exclusivity for sure. That's like what I'm trying to do but at the same time because

> 11:35 PM: That's why it's still like this. So it's like you can see some categories and you'll have like some

> 11:35 PM: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean like that's how it is on Fiverr too. Like you can't interact with it until you get on board and start like, you know, you get through the sign up process either as a creator or as a client. Yeah. Um

> 11:35 PM: as of right now it's just through wallet authentication so you can't message uh

> 11:35 PM: Okay. Um so I guess like for onboarding like creators and having them be part of the chapter app, what we're wanting is for them to have an off chain and on chain label where like if they have not yet come on chain and they're like maybe this is their first time visiting a chapter and they they just started setting up their account and they haven't even learned about crypto yet, but like maybe they're a great artist or creator or like, you know, and they're just going to start learning for the first time. They then will still have the off chain label and it won't require an account to be created with a wallet. It'll be more like a privy situation. So like, you know, in that case like it'll be like, you know, if it was created through a web two privy wallet and, you know, they've not yet gone through the initial crypto education like tutorial, like, you know, to prove that they have like the level one crypto certification, like that'll be and that's another thing is like we're going to be offering educational courses and certifications through the chapters. So that will be another thing that as you're looking through this marketplace, you'll be able to say like, I want to make sure that I get people who have actually gone through this course and that like they've been certified to be able to like provide this service. Yeah.

> 11:37 PM: that exact same thing like Fiverr certified, they have like quizzes that you can take to get like certified for like Photoshop.

> 11:37 PM: Yep, exactly, man. It's like all the same shit and it's all tied together in like the best way. Yeah.

> 11:37 PM: Yeah, I like that. I like that. Then then by any chance
